<p>Not just <a href="https://notes.dedenf.com/2019/02/google-product-confusing-as-hell">confusing</a>, and i agree that they have grew larger and became the new Microsoft, Google products designed only to be use optimally using Google Chrome.  <br />
And yes this is bad, not to mention Microsoft also adopting Chromium for their Microsoft Edge browser, and now Firefox is the browser that use rendering engine other than Chromium.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been using Firefox for quite some years now, and happy with it, and because Google being evil and some of their site are better with Chrome, i go with <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave browser</a>, itâ€™s a Chromium based browser, but with less tracker than Chrome implmented (hopefully!).</p>
