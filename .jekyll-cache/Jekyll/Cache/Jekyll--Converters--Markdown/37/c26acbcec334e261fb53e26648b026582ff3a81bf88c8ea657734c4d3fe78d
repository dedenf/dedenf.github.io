I"ó<p><strong>Dionysus, the god of wine, sets out the stages of inebriation</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For sensible men I prepare only three craters: one for health (which they drink first), the second for love and pleasure, and the third for sleep. After the third mixing bowl is drained, sensible men go home. The fourth crater is nothing to do with meâ€”it belongs to bad behavior; the fifth is for shouting; the sixth is for rudeness and insults; the seventh is for fights; the eighth is for breaking the furniture; the ninth is for depression; the tenth is for madness and unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Little nugget from the article.</p>

<p>Even until now, thereâ€™s no explanation about how the king died and what happen after that.</p>
