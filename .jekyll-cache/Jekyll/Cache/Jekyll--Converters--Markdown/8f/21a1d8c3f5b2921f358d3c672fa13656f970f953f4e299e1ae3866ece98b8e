I"¡<p>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro#Fourth_generation_.28Touch_Bar.29">Macbook Pro</a> that equipped with USB Type-c is quite challenging, not because itâ€™s bad, but this USB type is â€˜unconventionalâ€™, means, itâ€™s hard to connect your peripherals because all you have is USB Type-A connectors, buying an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ1M2AM/A/usb-c-to-usb-adapter">Apple USB-C to USB converter</a> seems ridiculously pricey, and this is a review-ish kinda thing.

Enter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go">OTG</a> (On The Go), and i bought an OTG device branded REMAX, i use the USB-C to USB-A type, it works, it can connect my mouse, external harddrive, iPhone, and other peripherals.

<p>Because it converting to USB 3.0 port, the speed is quite decend, the device benchmarked using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550?mt=12">Blackmagic Disk Speed Test</a> and <a href="http://www.xbench.com/">Xbench</a>, and it shows a decend speed, in terms of read and write.

<p>All and all, using the new device with ALL port using USB-C is quite cumbersome if you are using a lot of peripherals USB-A that needed to be connected.</p>
