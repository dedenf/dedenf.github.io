  <li><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/move-slowly-and-fix-things-e5a560fd928b?ref=dedenf">Move Slowly and Fix Things</a> – I do love this approach, do with small thing, fix that small thing, look upon what’s coming, iterate. i tried to keep things small, functional, add some stuff slowly and iterate to be better.

      <p>But now most software is so much more than that. It listens to us. It goes everywhere we go. It tracks everything we do. It has our fingerprints. Our heart rate. Our money. Our location. Our face. It’s the primary way we communicate our thoughts and feelings to our friends and family. <br />
It’s deeply personal and ingrained into every aspect of our lives. It commands our gaze more and more every day.</p>
