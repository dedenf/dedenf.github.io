<p>iâ€™ve been talking about sleep deprivation on my <a href="https://notes.dedenf.com/2017/11/dailybite-8?utm_source=dedenf">dailybite issue #8</a>, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/sleep-deprivation-epidemic-health-effects-tired-heart-disease-stroke-dementia-cancer-a7964156.html?utm_source=dedenf">how it affect how we live</a>, and society is changing, with all the gadgets, nightlife, always-on, fomo.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Electric lights, television and computer screens, longer commutes, the blurring of the line between work and personal time, and a host of other aspects of modern life have contributed to sleep deprivation, which is defined as less than seven hours a night. <br />
But this has been linked to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, obesity and poor mental health among other health problems. In short, a lack of sleep is killing us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sleep deprived have a higher risk of quite a number of conditions including heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and depression. Lack of sleep also has a deleterious effect on the brain, particularly on memory and cognition.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/how-to-sleep/508781/?utm_source=dedenf">healthy sleep</a>, thatâ€™s what we need, according that article, women need at least 7.63 hours of sleep, and men 7.76 hours of sleep, so thereâ€™s no hack for long we can stay awake without disturbing our sleep behaviour, and no, you cannot take some drugs as a replacement.</p>
