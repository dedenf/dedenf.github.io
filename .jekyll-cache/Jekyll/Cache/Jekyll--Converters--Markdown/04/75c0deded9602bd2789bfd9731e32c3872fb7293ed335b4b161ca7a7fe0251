  <p>“When you take a photo of something, you’re counting on the camera to remember for you,” Prof. Henkel says. “You’re basically saying, ‘Okay, I don’t need to think about this any further. The camera’s captured the experience.’ You don’t engage in any of the elaborative or emotional kinds of processing that really would help you remember those experiences, because you’ve outsourced it to your camera.”</p>

<p>This, indeed hit us hard, be mindful, remember where we stand, enjoy the moment. and i have to admit, sometimes i don’t remember exactly the experience, i just knew that i was there, but the be present when i was there is kinda hard, and it worst with smartphone in your pocket. to admire, to appriciate what’s in front of you, we need to do that and let our brain capture all of that experieces.</p>
