I"q<p>downloading package or setup composer.json could become a hassle.
instead, just go with this one line of command on terminal. make sure you already installed composer and put it in the system wide bin (eg. /usr/local/bin/).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ composer create-project laravel/laravel
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>this command also work if you want to setup a new package on composer packagist repo. for example installing Slimframework <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">composer create-project slim/slim</code></p>
