I"<p>did you always stuck in the morning reading news, hundred of rss feed, Flipboarding(?), and last but not least, Twitter or Facebook. they can suck all of your productive time.</p>

<p>but there’s a way to satisfy your need to tweets or update you status. you can use the tool that [hipster(?)] developer already knows, GIT.</p>

<p>see, i have a record <strong>7.777</strong> tweets right now, and i hate to break this number. and guess what, yes, i’ve been ranting/tweeting/etc via my commit message. This way i can get both satisfaction, by writing not-all-nonsense so-called tweet and i can get productive by making change on my code, if i want to ‘tweet’, i have to change/write codes!</p>

<p>P.S: i can also wrote a ‘blog’ <a href="https://github.com/dedenf/vagrant/commit/7467f6c1708795016818718e2dd66fda82645a93">like this one</a>, besides for my technical stuff i’ve been blogging on <a href="https://coderwall.com/dedenf">coderwall.com</a></p>
