I"È<p>Just like my previous post, titled <a href="/2019/10/read-maybe-later">‚ÄúRead maybe later‚Äù</a>, this quote from Seneca is a hard truth,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the abundance of books is distraction <br />
(distringit librorum multitudo )</p>

  <p>Seneca, 1AD</p>
</blockquote>

<!--more-->

<p>Sometimes you have too many books, paper or pixel, and you have too little time to read it, and it cluttered, forgotten, even sometime the seal still intact.</p>

<p>We are living with so many informations, so many knowledge that one could not absorb all of it, i remembered many technical paper that i have collected/downloaded over the year, and read only few of them, that‚Äôs the non-physical form, not to mention the physical books that i bought, links that i collected (Pocket or Instapaper), the amount of percentage that i successfully read are like 10-15% of it.</p>

<p>To be <a href="/2020/01/melakukan-kebiasaan-menulis-setiap-hari">more in writing</a>, i have to be more on reading.</p>
