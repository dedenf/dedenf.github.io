I"Ê<p>Iâ€™ve been Apple user for sometime, i got introduced to Apple product when iâ€™m using Powerbook from my boss back then, itâ€™s a great machine, i love the alumunium, love the keyboard, iâ€™m using Cheetah that time (10.0.0).</p>

<p>One of the issue iâ€™ve had right now with my Macbook Pro</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hardware choices in recent years may have helped make the MacBook Pro more fashionable, but it has become harder to use. The butterfly keyboard crystallises this approach with a preference for a light and thin design over-ruling a solid and dependable keyboard</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, the keyboard sucks, too many problem, from adding letter â€˜eâ€™, and now with this machine it added more spaces when iâ€™m typing, the keyboard are subpar, i prefer the old one, i donâ€™t mind if the machine thicker than current line up, as long as it worked.</p>

<p>So wanna try other laptop like XPC from Dell, or Spectre from HP, stuff it with Linux.</p>
