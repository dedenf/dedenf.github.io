I"¥<p>Small post dedicated about Serj, Iâ€™ve watched Game of thrones religiously, even though disappointed with the finale, and alread listen to Rain of castemere by Matt Berninger, recently just heard a version from Serj Tankian, the vocalist of System of a Down, oh god that is great version, i love this version a lot, you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlkgbwmN9mQ">should listen</a>!.</p>

<p>My first exposure to Serjâ€™s voice, of course with System of a Down, when they released self titled album, System of a down in 1998, and their following album, Toxicity, thereâ€™s a lot in this album, lots of anger, tell a lot of the story of social injustice, what happened to the world, their view of the world and things around it, and this is in 1998-2000-ish, his voice is amazing, very distinct with other band in the same era, like limp bizkit (<em>meh?</em>), or other band (i also love Rage Against the Machine).</p>
