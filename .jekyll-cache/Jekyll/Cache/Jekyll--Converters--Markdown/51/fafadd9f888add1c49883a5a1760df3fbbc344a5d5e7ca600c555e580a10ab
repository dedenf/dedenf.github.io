<p>As we may know, Google will shutdown google reader, a much beloved rss reader/service that many users have used it as their daily activity. i’ve been using Google reader for a long time, as alternative i’ve found <a href="https://theoldreader.com/">The Old Reader</a> as my replacement for Google Reader, Today i found about <a href="https://readable.cc/">redable.cc</a>.</p>

<p>It’s not like usual rss reader that has ‘folder’ like icon, but instead it has a list with big heading information about what rss that we’ve been subscribed. it has a simple interface with serif typeface all over the place (which is a good thing for readable purpose).
Think i might use it for a while.</p>
