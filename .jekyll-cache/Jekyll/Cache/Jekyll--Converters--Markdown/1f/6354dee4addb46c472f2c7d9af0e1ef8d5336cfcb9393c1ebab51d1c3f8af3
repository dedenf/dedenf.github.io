<h4 id="addons-management">Addons Management</h4>
<p>I think thereâ€™s no radical change from this feature compared with the old one, but this UI look and feel a bit fresh.

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>This new release, Firefox Quantum has been proven fast!, i love it, yes it uses purely 64bit, new design, i like it, just need to get used to with black bar (yes you can customize it, but still..), in the Chrome world it is an Incognito mode. the syncing account works fine. Probably this is the right time to come back using it.</p>
