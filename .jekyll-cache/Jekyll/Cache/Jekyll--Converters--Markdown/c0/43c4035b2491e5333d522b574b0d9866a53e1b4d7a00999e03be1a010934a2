I"A<p>Attempting to find and use Mail.app alternatives is quite hard, Mailapp itself is already mature in my opinion, all the feature are there, no gimmick, no fancy add ons that will make you miserable sometimes.</p>

<p>I’ve been using quite a lot alternatives, like <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>, <a href="https://canarymail.io/">Canary</a>, <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/">Spark</a>, <a href="https://cloudmagic.com/">CloudMagic</a>, <a href="https://www.postbox-inc.com/">Postbox</a>. still they can’t beat Mail.app (this is debatable), and right now, i was introduced to Mailspring. Mailspring is Electron-based app, like many of app that i have mentioned before, it’s free for basic tier, and $8/mo if you want to have extra feature (i’m fine with this current basic tier).</p>
