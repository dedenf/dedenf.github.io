<p>A <a href="http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf">study</a> by Bonita Sharif and Jonathan I. Maletic from Department of Computer Science
Kent State University about how the eye response to camelCase and under_score indentifier, or might be function or variable naming style.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Visual effort is determined using six measures based on eye gaze data namely: fixation counts and durations. Although, no
difference was found between identifier styles with respect to accuracy, results indicate a significant improvement in time and lower visual effort with the underscore style.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>personally, i like underscore rather than camelCase, itâ€™s more readable and concise, and easily to read between word.</p>
