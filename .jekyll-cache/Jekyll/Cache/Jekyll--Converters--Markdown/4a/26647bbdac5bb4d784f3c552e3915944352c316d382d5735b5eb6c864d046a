Interesting read, and in fact reflects to at least my professional life, the over-designed and over-architecture system that sometimes hurting the delivery, not to mention the business. the point to make in my opinion is as developer we should be wise and also thoughful using all the hyped or cool kids technologies</p>

Communication is the key in development word, communication can be anywhere and using any tools that we have, slack, telegram, whatsapp, or even in the codes, how we connect with other developer and so, but sometimes ego will kill it all, the attitude like iâ€™m the best, i donâ€™t need help from the other. remember there are human behind the code that we wrote, human who make it all possible, your colleague, your open source tools that you use.</p>
