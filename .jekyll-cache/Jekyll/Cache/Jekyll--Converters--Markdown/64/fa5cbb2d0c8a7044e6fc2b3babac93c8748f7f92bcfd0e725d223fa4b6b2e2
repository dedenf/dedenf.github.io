<p>Been a fan of <a href="/2017/11/firefox-quantum">Firefox</a> for <a href="/2016/05/firefox-testpilot">a while</a>, testing out their new services (and they shut it down) or just using <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">their products</a> on a <a href="https://getpocket.com/">daily basis</a>, now they launched <a href="https://lockwise.firefox.com/">Lockwise</a>.</p>

<p>This one though is a huge jump for me, a password manager, iâ€™ve been a loyal and fans of <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> to manage my passwords, and can Lockwise replace 1Password?</p>

<p>Firefox as a browser could store our credentials and stored it in their cloud, and could sync it between devices, that only effective if you are a Firefox user of course, by using Lockwise, those app will share and sync the same credentials that we manage, from browser or via Lockwise app. and can pull out the credentials (username, password) from Lockwise when we need to login say on the mobile app, just like 1Password did.</p>
