I"E<p>Hello.</p>

<p>Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It’s mobile <em>first</em>, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.</p>

<p>It’s pretty minimal, but leverages large type and drastic contrast to make a statement, on all devices.</p>
