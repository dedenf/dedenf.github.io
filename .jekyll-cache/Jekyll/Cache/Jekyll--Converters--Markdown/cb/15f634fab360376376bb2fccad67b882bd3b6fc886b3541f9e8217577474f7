I"‹<p>Been <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> user since for 3 years now, and its service never disappointed, even though iâ€™m using their free user tier, but the service is awesome, currently i have many sites hosted in their platform, all of my domain hosted there also, this blog one of them.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s my build stats on Netlify, i have been published few post on my other blog <a href="https://seputarfinansial.com">seputarfinansial.com</a>, <a href="https://jakartadev.org">jakartadev.org</a>, <a href="https://seputarinvestasi.com">seputarinvestasi.com</a>, and others.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/netlify-build-dedenf.png" alt="monthly build" /></p>

<p>They gave its users a generous perks, like build times quota, i got 300 minutes build time quota monthly, in a month my sites consumed roughly about 100 - 200 minutes, and i still have plenty more.</p>

<p>Thank you Netlify!</p>
