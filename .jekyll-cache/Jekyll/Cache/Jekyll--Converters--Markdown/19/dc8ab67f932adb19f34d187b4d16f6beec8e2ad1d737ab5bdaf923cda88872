I"<p>mashable has wrapup the that mistake by young startup often did, here’s the recap.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Forgoing Simplicity</li>
  <li>Waiting Too Long to Launch</li>
  <li>Hiring Poorly</li>
  <li>Not Embracing Agility</li>
  <li>Guarding The “Big Idea”</li>
  <li>Losing Focus</li>
  <li>Assuming Virality</li>
  <li>Obsessing Over Funding</li>
  <li>Chasing Investors Instead of Befriending Investees</li>
  <li>Dwelling on Things</li>
  <li>Getting Distracted By Feedback</li>
  <li>Not Having the Right Co-Founder</li>
  <li>Trying to Win Over Everyone</li>
  <li>Not Listening to Current (or Future) Customers</li>
  <li>Jumping to Decisions</li>
  <li>Not Maintaining Relationships</li>
</ol>

<p>i’d like to mention point 2, it’s like every young startup did it, from their persfective, they want to impress their users with bunch of feature at once, but this is the main reason that sometimes they delayed the launch date.</p>
