I"<p>Currently i’m trying to use Safari more than before, this idea coming because using Chrome is pain in the ass in terms of resources, and by simple thought, probably if i use Safari as a default browser it could dramatically change how my browsing experience and also its resources.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I still use El Capitan macOS, i hate Sierra, the iCloud integration seems annoying (i do have other backup strategy tho), i’ve installed Sierra on my other macs, and regretting it.</p>

<p>And using Safari (on El Capitan) did not improve my browsing experience, and sometimes the page did not loaded perfectly, probably the site, but <em>again</em> on Chrome it is smooth.</p>

<p>probably if high Sierra released, i’ll give it a try its Safari, according to WWDC, it has tons of improvements.</p>
