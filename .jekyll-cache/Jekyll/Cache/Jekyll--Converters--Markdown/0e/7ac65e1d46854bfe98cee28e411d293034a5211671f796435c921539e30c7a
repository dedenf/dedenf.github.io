  <p>Our fear of other people’s opinions, or FOPO as I call it, has become an irrational and unproductive obsession in the modern world, and its negative effects reach far beyond performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This FOPO eats up our confidence, we lived by other people’s opinions that probably knows nothing about us. look, everyone has their own struggle that we dont know. But mosty, this FOPO are only in our head, we tend to care what might come from other people’s head than minding our own growth.</p>

<p>The way to get around this according to the article, build a personal philosophy, starts with answering the question</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When I’m at my best, what beliefs lie just beneath the surface of my thoughts and actions?</p>

  <p>Who are people that demonstrate characteristics and qualities that are in alignment with mine?</p>

  <p>What are those qualities?</p>

  <p>What are your favorite quotes? Your favorite words?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Circle the words you choose, develope the philosophy, commit, live with that philosphy, and that’s who we can learn and grow.</p>

<p>it’s a journey.</p>
