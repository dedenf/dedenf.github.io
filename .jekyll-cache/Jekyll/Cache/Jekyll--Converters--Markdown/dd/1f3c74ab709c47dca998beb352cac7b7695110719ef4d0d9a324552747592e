I"d<p>Since i love genre like triphop, lounge, chill etc, and i also love rain, love the sound, and it smells, a <em>Pluviophile</em> they said.</p>

<p>To have maximum concentration are hard, using an open office for some people probably a good thing, <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-open-plan-office-is-a-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-idea-42bd9cd294e3">but not for other people</a>, and the solution are, people start wearing headphones/earphone to have a maximum focus.</p>

<p>To have that focus, i tend to use these tool, yes, i use earphone, and listened to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5FsfZj0Mp6YwEWytuJUcWt">Jinsang</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5RbI1PF4n02wWKmgjk7hAE">Barasuara</a>, and install this app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/noizio-focus-relax-sleep/id928871589?mt=12">Noizio</a>, their <a href="http://noiz.io/">website</a>. <br />
Listening to music and sound of rain and people chatter in the background (itâ€™s a Noizio sound btw), and sometimes thunder (Noizio also), is quite comforting and i have a bit of focus and can do deep work.</p>
