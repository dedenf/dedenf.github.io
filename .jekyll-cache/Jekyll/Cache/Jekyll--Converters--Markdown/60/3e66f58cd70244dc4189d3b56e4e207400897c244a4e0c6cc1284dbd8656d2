I"<p>read a post from <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/">dalton caldwell</a> about <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/touring-by-yourself">Touring yourself</a></p>

<p>i love this quote</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Going “indie” is clearly not for everyone, but I have the utmost respect for the people that are able and willing to do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if you read the whole post, you’ll get what his meant. and i think personally, there’s a connection of how you become a grown ups, especially when you were married, you support your family by what you were doing right now.</p>

<p>that kinda responsibility is not bounded by age, any age who matches criteria like supporting family and the love ones is considered a grown-ups, responsible for himself and other.</p>
