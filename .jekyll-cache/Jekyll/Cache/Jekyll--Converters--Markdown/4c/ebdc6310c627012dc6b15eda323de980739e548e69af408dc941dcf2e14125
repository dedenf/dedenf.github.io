I"f<p>Recently today i tried a feature published by Mozilla Firefox, it called Testpilot, basically itâ€™s a playground for Firefox team to add new feature on their browser, and test it.</p>

<p>Currently there are 3 feature that has been rolled out, <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/tab-center">Tab center</a>, <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/activity-stream">Activity Streaming</a>, and <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/universal-search">Universal Search</a>, the most significant is Tab center, it change how we react with Tabs.</p>

<p>Not hated it, but old habbit die hard, it used to be on the top of the browser, now it moved to the side, a bit weird i think, but let see if it improve the experience.</p>

<p><em><strong>update (<time datetime="2016-08-03">2016-08-03</time>) :</strong> they updated the look and feel, and adding few changes, now it displayed page preview instead of favicon.</em></p>
