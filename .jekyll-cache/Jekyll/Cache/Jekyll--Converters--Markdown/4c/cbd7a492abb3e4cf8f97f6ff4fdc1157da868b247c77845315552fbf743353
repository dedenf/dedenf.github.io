<p>I got to know this site and its gamification just yesterday. yes i love coffee, even <a href="https://epicoffee.com">bought a domain</a> for that (was too occupied to update it :p).</p>

<p>Instant order, but too bad theyâ€™re out of stock, have to wait for a while.</p>

<p>Love how well the website crafted, especially the typeface, concise, just love it. props to the developers and designers!</p>
