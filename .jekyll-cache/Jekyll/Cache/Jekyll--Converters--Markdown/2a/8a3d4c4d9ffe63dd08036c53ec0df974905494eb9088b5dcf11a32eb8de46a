I"€<p>Found this project via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/23/17773180/microsoft-windows-95-app-download-features">the verge</a>, i can run Windows 95 on my mac, itâ€™s a bit nostalgic, you can see it screenshot below, i first run this windows 95 in about 1997, and still using it until 98, but i still remember my friend still using win95, until 2000, and using Windows 95 Plus! as its theme.</p>

<p>Because back in the day the space on the harddrive are very limited, i had 250MB worth of space, with windows 95 consuming around 120-<em>ish</em> MB, and the rest of it either for office, code (coding with pascal, assembly, c), files or music.
