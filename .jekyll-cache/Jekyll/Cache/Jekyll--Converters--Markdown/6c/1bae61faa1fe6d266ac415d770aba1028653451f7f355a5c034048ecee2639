  <p>“Wow,” I thought to myself, “the goal of testing is to protect the customer from evil bugs created by evil developers, and the ultimate manifestation of that goal is to slip the ship date!” That misguided belief stuck with me and drove many of my behaviors around software testing for nearly a decade.</p>

<p>There are many misguded belief around software testing, they should help developers also and present some solution for every bug or <em>future-bug</em> that they think will hinder either devs or end users.</p>

<p>To have so many scenarios around testing, it will involving devs, and i kinda agree when QA and software tester engineer sits or doing test together with devs, PO within the same squad (no, this is not only applied to agile/scrum), it will creates dynamics within the team.</p>
