I"Ä<p>Been playing with twitter bootstrap for a while now, iâ€™m considering to make this bootstrap template as my starting point of my project.</p>

<p>for the past 3 days, iâ€™ve been working creating a <a href="http://patungan.co">patungan</a> design template. lots of tear to create a slightly similar look to <a href="https://kickstarter.com">kickstarter</a>.</p>

<p>look at this <a href="https://d.pr/Fh6R">design</a></p>

<p>and now, trying to build a forecasting systemm. still using the same basic bootstrap template from <a href="https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.</p>

<p>The thing is, creating smart app tool like forecasting system is take a while, regarding of the formula, mining past data and so on.
for now, iâ€™m making my own design system, taking from couple of source.</p>

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>patungan is renamed to <a href="https://wujudkan.com">wujudkan.com</a>, go make some project over there!</p>
