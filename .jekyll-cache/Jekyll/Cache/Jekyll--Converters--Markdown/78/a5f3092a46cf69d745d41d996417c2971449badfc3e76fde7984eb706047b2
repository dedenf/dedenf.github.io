I"Î<p>Came across this blog post, titled ‚Äú<a href="https://www.benfrederickson.com/github-wont-help-with-hiring/">Why GitHub Won‚Äôt Help You With Hiring</a>‚Äù</p>

  <p>Instead, this post is about why GitHub profiles just aren‚Äôt all that useful when looking to hire developers.</p>

<p>Interesting article, different takes of how github profile won‚Äôt help boost our profile in the development world, and the points are valid, for some people.</p>

<p>While i do agree most of the stuff, and i have my view also about this, it‚Äôs a little different with my experience, since i have been an engineering manager for quite sometimes, I do checked people, or candidates, when I‚Äôm hiring, on GitHub, to see a glimps of her/his involvements if any, it‚Äôs like stalking the candidates, and if they contributed to opensource, that‚Äôs a plus, especially if the OSS is a huge project.</p>

<p>And for my personal opinion, aside for account name reserved, having my handle @dedenf on Github, is that I have piece of code contributed, and i feel safe to store my code, documents, on my GitHub account.</p>

<p>While i do have another account in BitBucket, GitLab and other place, GitHub is my first choice to store and contribute.</p>
