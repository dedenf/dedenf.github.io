I"·<p>as been discussed on id-gmail mailing list, naming a server name is hard, sometimes you have to pick a theme for your servers, thereâ€™s some who named their server using mountain name, or using Myth Gods names, and sometime some ladyâ€™s names like dewi, julie.
itâ€™s hard because sometimes once you named one of your server you should know its purpose, its capabilities based on their representative name, for example Zeus, itâ€™s a main server that have a significant purpose on the network.</p>
