I"¢<p>last year i bought few domain, i just bought it, and never had a chance to think what am i gonna do with it,
to name a few, i bought <a href="https://pakeapa.com">pakeapa.com</a>, when i decided to bought it, i think of itâ€™s like a blog
that contain information about software, open source or anything else that other people do, have, had.</p>

<p>and it turns out it did, even the content has been evolving into like an interview (it did!), it borrows the idea from <a href="https://usesthis.com">usesthis</a>.
and iâ€™m glad Daniel (the onwer of the blog) is pleased and listed pakeapa.com on his site, and heâ€™s such a nice guy, gave some advice of how i could improve.</p>

<p>second, i bought <a href="https://jakartadev.org">Jakartadev.org</a>, itâ€™s basically a newsletter service, focusing on developers, opensource, technology.
itâ€™s a weekly newsletter, i will send it every monday, it contain a lot of information, tutorial, and tools that you could use to speed up developement,
curated by yours trully, and i hope it will become a habit for me to read tutorials, howto, or anything that could improve my dev skills.</p>

<p>i hope you enjoy it as much as i do.</p>
