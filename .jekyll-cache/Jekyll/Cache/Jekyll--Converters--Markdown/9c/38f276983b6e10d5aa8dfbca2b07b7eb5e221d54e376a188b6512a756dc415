I"ë<p>i will buy Last.fm.</p>

<p>create a â€˜channel-app-likeâ€™, so weâ€™ve got status stream (text), photos, video, and last but not least, Audio. thatâ€™s where Last.fm coming.</p>

<p>as we know that Spotify is already built in to the Facebook, itâ€™s easier to integrate both of them. status flooding is something that many user would not love, so for the audio, the traffic will be huge, donâ€™t bother about putting what other people listened into their wall. just donâ€™t do that.</p>
