<p>I used to listen podcast using either spotify, or soundcloud, itunes, depending on how the publisher published the podcast, but probably that will be change, right now i use <a href="https://getstream.io/winds/">Winds app</a> by <a href="https://getstream.io/">getstream.io</a>.</p>

<p>The app displayed like itâ€™s a website, consist of podcast and rss news feed, i use Winds as my main podcast client, so simple and intuitive, support podfaster, bookmarking, also can resume it after we left of if we closed it.</p>
