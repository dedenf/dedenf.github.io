at my [coderwall](https://coderwall.com/dedenf) page, i wrote about [OSX HTTP client](https://coderwall.com/p/kw6mbg?i=2&p=1&q=author%3Adedenf&t%5B%5D=dedenf "osx http client url"), it's a great app, but sometimes i want more of it, i want to craft the request intuitively with easy option to set up, and i want it without have to open another app.

A long came [PostMan](http://www.getpostman.com/), a chrome extension and A powerful HTTP client to test REST web services. a tool that i use extensively for the past 2 month, it support many http verb that RESTafarian would fall in love with. go ahead, try it.
