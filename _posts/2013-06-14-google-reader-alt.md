As we may know, Google will shutdown google reader, a much beloved rss reader/service that many users have used it as their daily activity. i've been using Google reader for a long time, as alternative i've found [The Old Reader](http://theoldreader.com/) as my replacement for Google Reader, Today i found about [redable.cc](http://readable.cc/).

It's not like usual rss reader that has 'folder' like icon, but instead it has a list with big heading information about what rss that we've been subscribed. it has a simple interface with serif typeface all over the place (which is a good thing for readable purpose).
Think i might use it for a while.
