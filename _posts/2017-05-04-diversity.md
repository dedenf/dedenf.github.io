in tech industry scene, there's a lot of talent, from backend, frontend, products, QA and other roles that important on the tech sections,
and these talent came from a lot of background, especially in Indonesia, where its multicultural, races (it's probably more than 300+ races),
with that in mind, diversity is something to cherished.

In many research, work in the diversity have [many](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/67c5/89f2632f6ce8f7ed45082e3f0915436ffeda.pdf) benefits for the member of the organization, but it also came with challenges of itself. i am lucky enough to be working in the diversity environment, gender, race, language. they will learn each other culture, sometimes languages. yes, it is quite challenging if other party did not have a basic common knowledge when they do communication. i was once have an 'argument' over chat, but the other party use capital to communicate certain words, and it is considered rude by communication standard, and that person got a hard lesson eventually.

another thing that i could point out, like, the more junior person could tap in to more senior person, learn from their experience, and maybe wisdom. as for more senior, they could see what they've learn is usefull and can be applied
