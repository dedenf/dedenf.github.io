Been playing with twitter bootstrap for a while now, i'm considering to make this bootstrap template as my starting point of my project.

for the past 3 days, i've been working creating a [patungan](http://patungan.co) design template. lots of tear to create a slightly similar look to [kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com).

look at this [design](http://d.pr/Fh6R)

and now, trying to build a forecasting systemm. still using the same basic bootstrap template from [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

The thing is, creating smart app tool like forecasting system is take a while, regarding of the formula, mining past data and so on.
for now, i'm making my own design system, taking from couple of source.


**update**

patungan is renamed to [wujudkan.com](http://wujudkan.com), go make some project over there!
