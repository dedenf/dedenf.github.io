> ... it's very hard not to believe or take Nightingale's comments seriously. Slowly but surely, Google is becoming the new Microsoft, and Chrome is slowly turning into the new IE...

Not just [confusing](https://notes.dedenf.com/2019/02/google-product-confusing-as-hell), and i agree that they have grew larger and became the new Microsoft, Google products designed only to be use optimally using Google Chrome.    
And yes this is bad, not to mention Microsoft also adopting Chromium for their Microsoft Edge browser, and now Firefox is the browser that use rendering engine other than Chromium. 

I've been using Firefox for quite some years now, and happy with it, and because Google being evil and some of their site are better with Chrome, i go with [Brave browser](https://brave.com/), it's a Chromium based browser, but with less tracker than Chrome implmented (hopefully!).
