Probably readers of this blog knows that this site built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a blog engine that i currently using, i'm using this because simplicity and also ease of use, free and supported by [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), code hosting, site publishing is all free.

I've been try other static generator blog engine like Hugo or Ghost, and it always get back to Jekyll, dunno why.

For publishing this site, i'm using :  
- [Jekyll SEO tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/)
- Jekyll Paginate (currently obsolete, since Jekyll 3, this was moved to core)
- [Jekyll sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap)
- Github Pages (this more like a ruby gems not Jekyll Plugin)
