This blog site are built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a blog engine that i currently using and loved, i'm using Jekyll because its simplicity and also ease of use, it's free and Jekyll also on e of the blog engine that supported by [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), site publishing it's all free, and not to mention all of the code stored in Github, that's also free.

I've been try other static generator blog engine like Hugo or Ghost, and it always get back to Jekyll, dunno why.

For publishing this site, i'm using :  
- [Jekyll SEO tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/)
- Jekyll Paginate (currently obsolete, since Jekyll 3, this was moved to core)
- [Jekyll sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap)
- [jekyll-relative-links](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-relative-links)
- Github Pages (this more like a ruby gems not Jekyll Plugin)
- Bulma CSS for styling

Jekyll SEO tag helps a lot for maximazing and optimazing the SEO performance, with few thousands a month visitor, that's what motivates me to write.
