This is amazing post by [Leigh McKiernon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leighmckiernon/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BG2vuUZCESgmfVE%2FU0c2WBw%3D%3D), this is exactly what’s happening in Indonesia, I have attended quite a lot of conference last year, mostly tech related, from Digital Summit something, security trend, and yes, Unlocking something.

> Every month, Jakarta’s luxury hotels transform into theaters of corporate pageantry, hosting yet another "groundbreaking, future-shaping" event. The theme? Some version of "Unlocking Indonesia’s Potential"—as if the country is a locked treasure chest that just needs the right combination of PowerPoint slides to open.

And these lines are the kicker.

> If you’ve attended more than one Indonesian business conference, you’ve probably experienced an eerie sense of déjà vu. Same hotel ballroom. Same buffet. Same talking points. And, most importantly, the same speakers.

> Welcome to the elite world of **Indonesia’s Panel Mafia**—an exclusive club where the main qualification isn’t execution, but sheer endurance in repeating the same buzzwords for years without consequence. These people don’t just attend conferences; they orbit them like celestial bodies, forever circling but never landing.

Many probably had a conference fatigue, not to mention tired chased by account managers, sales person, etc, since our credentials were shared to the sponsors, they have time to ask your time.
