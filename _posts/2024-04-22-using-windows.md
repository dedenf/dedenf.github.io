In short, right now, currently been using Windows 11, and so far i'm quite happy with it, let me break it down.

I have been a macOS user since 2005 (or it called OSX back then, Panther), and more than happy using it, and quite used to and grown to love it along side with Linux Mandrake on my desktop computer, and eventually using OSX on the daily basis, last time using windows was around 2003, and the last windows version i've been used is windows XP.

Skipped a lot of windows versions, now jump to my current windows version, which is Windows 11.

Quite surprise with the release, been on and off using windows, mostly acted as IT support for friends and family, reinstall their windows, whichever version they were using, and never quite like it, i preferred using Linux, it's hard to use windows for development setup.

And i think it's changed now, with my limited knowledge about windows, i think using windows 11 is great for development setup, i can have almost all of my tools for development setup when in my macOS, i could have all of the nice things like containerization (docker, podman, or even orchestration like kubernetes), compiler (go, rust), scripts (python, ruby, nodejs, etc), and as mentioned before, it can run container, so using whole a lot of linux flavor is a matter of choices, and practically it can run whatever languange you are using for development, and whatever database if you need it.

Windows also could run [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), which is a linux subsystem for windows, and it's a great thing to have, i can have a "dedicated" linux environment on windows.

For a moment, forgot that this is a windows machine.
