![TLDR;](/images/posts/tldr.png)

These day if i'm stumbling around the terminal, and doing some `brew` or [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), sometimes i look up the **Updated Formulae** status, and found a lot of gem, one of it [TLDR](https://tldr.sh/).

It will displayed man page, with only most used or short as possible, and it is maintaned by community.
