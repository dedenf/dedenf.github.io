Hey it's rhyme!
on my system right now, i have two timemachine who backed up my entire system, one i had it on my whole dedicated external drive, it's an old 320GB Seagate drive, and in my [DAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Attached_Storage) system (i named it "Kimu Garden", because it's sounds beautiful) as a backup in sparsedisk image.

On my 320GB Seagate drive i'm using plain TimeMachine app, as for sparsedisk i use [carbon copy cloner](http://www.bombich.com/) (i use the free one) as backup app, maybe having 2 backup for my machine is overkill, but hey, nobody knows when shit happens.

my work files is on dropbox, exclude the codes, all my code is either on TimeMachine or in the Sparsedisk image.

i also subscribed to other online backup system, i use GDrive, Skydrive. but one thing about skydrive, it's allows you to upload the file without having to syncronize it on to your machine, which is great, i uploaded some of the sensitive data on to it, with sparsedisk protection of course, and doesn't have to mirror that file on my machine.

i want to have a system that can do the backup for me, i heard backblaze have amazing service and cheap comparing to the other services
