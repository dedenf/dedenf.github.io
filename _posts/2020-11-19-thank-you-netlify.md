Been [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) user since for 3 years now, and its service never disappointed, even though i'm using their free user tier, but the service is awesome, currently i have many sites hosted in their platform, all of my domain hosted there also, this blog one of them.

Here's my build stats on Netlify, i have been published few post on my other blog [seputarfinansial.com](https://seputarfinansial.com), [jakartadev.org](https://jakartadev.org), [seputarinvestasi.com](https://seputarinvestasi.com), and others.

They gave its users a generous perks, like build times quota, i got 300 minutes build time quota monthly, in a month my sites consumed roughly about 100 - 200 minutes, and i still have plenty more.

Thank you Netlify!
