Notion keeps getting better, and this time they release a new product, Notion Mail, not long before they released a Calendar app, not so much different with usual Calendar app, but in can integrated well with  Notion, and also can be used as a standalone app.

With Notion Mail, surely it can intergrate well with Notion, currently only support Gmail, in the future, maybe it can support other email provider.
