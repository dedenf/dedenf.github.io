as been discussed on id-gmail mailing list, naming a server name is hard, sometimes you have to pick a theme for your servers, there's some who named their server using mountain name, or using Myth Gods names, and sometime some lady's names like dewi, julie.
it's hard because sometimes once you named one of your server you should know its purpose, its capabilities based on their representative name, for example Zeus, it's a main server that have a significant purpose on the network.
