It's a rather alarming article, at least for me who are always relied on technology, or in this case an AI, for knowledge search, learn something, or even making a decision about what to do next.

This paragraph tells the story.

> These are examples of a broader phenomenon that psychologists call cognitive offloading â€” when we outsource the burden of performing mental tasks to external tools, like an AI model. Cognitive offloading can be helpful, disencumbering our brains of having to perform tedious work so we can focus on more fulfilling pursuits, or harder brain tasks that deserve more attention. But you can get too much of a good thing. 

As we relied heavily on AI, some people call it "second brain" or "third brain", but what happen is, we make our brain lazy, we don't need to remember anything, we just need to ask the AI.

Hell, even this editor, i plugged in an AI agent for codes and stuff, and it's still gave me a suggestion on how to write this article, see image below.

How easy was that? if i keep doing this, i'll be a lazy man, i won't use my brain how to tailor a sentence, or how to write a paragraph, or even how to write a sentence.

Just need a bit mindful and keep use our brain as long as we can.
