Upgraded to latest Apple macOS High Sierra, i think i love it, and i think this is the first time i upgraded the system without waiting x.x.1 (10.12.1 for example). couple thing that i considered as things i hate, digital clock (now with dot, e.g 10.12), how it displayed the size of the file or transfer (now with comma, e.g _Transfering 10,3MB_)

Couple review from other site

**update 3 October 2017**    
since i'm using Macbook Pro with touchbar, i can't swipe between desktop, sometimes it broken, don't know whether it's related, it has different trackpad, checked my uptime and it says only 7 days up, bummer.
