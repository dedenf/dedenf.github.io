I hope you’re happy.](https://medium.com/@deusexmachina667/you-fired-your-top-talent-i-hope-youre-happy-cf57c41183dd) -- it is basically a shout out to previous article ([read here first](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-fired-our-top-talent-best-decision-we-ever-made-4c0a99728fde?gi=fbc062e62a4)), all argument on both article could be right, i have seen both of the case, from the developer itself and from the company who were don't give a damn to the developers.

- [_Thor: Ragnarok’s_ Taika Waititi Is Here to Save the Blockbuster](https://www.gq.com/story/taika-waititi-thor-ragnarok-profile) -- it's a fun movie btw, but not much i can remember, it's just many laughter, funny character, after watch it, it's just... gone.
