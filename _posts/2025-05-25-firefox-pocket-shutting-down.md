Welp, this is like all of sudden, using this app since a long time, before it was bought by Mozilla, still named as Read it Later, this a go app for bookmarking articles I've found on the interwebs

There's few alternatives for this kind of service, like [Matter](https://getmatter.com), [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/), [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) and few other.

For those who wanted to move to other service, most of the bookmark service provide an import capability, first we need to import our bookmarks from [Pocket via this link](https://getpocket.com/export), and Pocket will send the exported file (.csv) to our email, and we can import that file to our new service.

It's not a hassle to move, but still, I'll miss Pocket, and thank you for serving me as one of your user.
