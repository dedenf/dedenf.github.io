Just last week, Apple introduced new 16" Macbook Pro line up, and i've complained about [Macbook Pro](https://notes.dedenf.com/2019/11/apple-macbook-pro-sucks) for quite [some times](https://notes.dedenf.com/2017/12/worst-macbookpro). 

As per [iFixit reported](https://www.ifixit.com/News/16-inch-macbook-pro-magic-keyboard-throwback) (re-reported by [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/11/15/20966926/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-teardown-ifixit-keyboard-switches-scissor-butterfly)) about the new 16" Macbook Pro with "new" keyboard, which is basically an old scissor keyboard.
