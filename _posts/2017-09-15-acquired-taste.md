Have you ever have a thing that used to be you dislike and from time to time you were changed and began to like the thing that you dislike? maybe by experiece, by how we approach things differently, or you just forced it and become a habit and it suddenly less sucks than it used to be.

I used to be dislike coffee without sugar, it's bitter, nothing else, but through out the time, i began to enjoy coffee without sugar after couple of time tasting it, and also using different approach of how i tasted the coffee, buying couple coffee brewing tools and different varieties of coffee, single origin or blend, or whatever. bought a domain name for my love for coffee ([http://epicoffee.com](http://epicoffee.com)), this thing also happened to Guinness, Wine.
