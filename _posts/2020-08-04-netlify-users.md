Been using and fans of Netlify, using it for [all](https://seputarfinansial.com) [of](https://jakartadev.org) [my blogs](https://seputardevops.com), [this blog](https://notes.dedenf.com) included, and according to the Netlify, since they are currently aiming for 1 Million users, i was at #185.019, happy customer, not yet using their premium feature, the basic one still enough for me.

Thanks [Netlify](https://netlify.com)!
