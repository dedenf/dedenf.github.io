[Choiceology](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/podcast) is the latest podcast that i've been listening to, it tells about how human behavior affecting their daily life, their decision, it could be about finance, food choices, how they want to exercise and abandon that plan. it is all human behavior, and since this is Schwab, it has something to do with human financial decision.

My favorite episode is [A Clean Slate from Season 2 Episode 5](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/choiceology-season-2-episode-5). Small change and determination could have a big impact for Ray Zahab.
