Don't know where i have been, [these Hooverphonic concert](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbsgOyRLYNfZk-7fJE7iXt26_Y6888B36) with an orchestra is AMAZING!, the symfony, vocals, everything, it's just perfect.

I was first introduced with triphop songs by my late-friend Taufik (GBU my friend), he introduced me to the type of Portishead, Hooverphonic, Lamb, Goldfrapp, etc. i was hooked, need more, just listening to a cassette (it's year 2000 after all), mp3 is just booming, file sharing is everywhere (napster, kazaa, -- _yeah old_), and i admit it that i was using that service a while back just to get the [2Wicky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJSQxbedplM) and [Mad About You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EA-MIYY1bg) from Hooverphonic in MP3 format.
