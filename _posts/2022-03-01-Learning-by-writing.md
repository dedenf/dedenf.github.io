These workflow are amazing


> The rough basic idea is that I organize my learning around writing rather than reading. This doesn’t mean I don’t read - just that the reading is always in service of the writing.

### Here’s an outline:

- Step 1 -- Pick a topic
- Step 2 -- Read and/or discuss with others (a bit)
- Step 3 -- Explain and defend my current, incredibly premature hypothesis, in writing (or conversation)
- Step 4 -- Find and list weaknesses in my case
- Step 5 -- Pick a subquestion and do more reading/discussing
- Step 6 -- Revise my claim / switch sides
- Step 7 -- Repeat steps 3-6 a bunch
- Step 8 -- Get feedback on a draft from others, and use this to keep repeating steps 3-6 

The detail how-to were very consice, recommended for reading.
