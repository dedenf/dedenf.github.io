> I was once on a flight with a CEO – he let everyone know that’s what he was – who lost his mind after we had to change gates twice. I wondered: How did he make it this far in life without the ability to deal with petty annoyances outside of his control? The most likely answer is that he lives in denial over what he thinks he’s in control of, and demands unrealistic precision from subordinates who compensate by hiding bad news.

It's true, life full of bullshit, but that doesn't mean you should stop or avoid all of the bullshit, just enough to get by, we tolerate them and then move on. Is it worth it to go to the hassle by fighting all of the bullshit?
