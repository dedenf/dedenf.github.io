Recently today i tried a feature published by Mozilla Firefox, it called Testpilot, basically it's a playground for Firefox team to add new feature on their browser, and test it.

Currently there are 3 feature that has been rolled out, [Tab center](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/tab-center), [Activity Streaming](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/activity-stream), and [Universal Search](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/universal-search), the most significant is Tab center, it change how we react with Tabs.

Not hated it, but old habbit die hard, it used to be on the top of the browser, now it moved to the side, a bit weird i think, but let see if it improve the experience.

_**update (<time datetime="2016-08-03">2016-08-03</time>) :** they updated the look and feel, and adding few changes, now it displayed page preview instead of favicon._
