> Eratosthenes knew that the distance between 
Alexandria and Syene was approximately 800 kilometers, because he hired a man to pace it 
out. Eight hundred kilometers times 50 is 40,000 kilometers: so that must be the 
circumference of the Earth.

It was known that earth is not flat, even from 2000 years ago. this script from Carl Sagan are amazing. and specially this narration from him.
