in operating system, there's a term called Daemon, according to wikipedia :
>In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon (/ˈdeɪmən/ or /ˈdiːmən/)[1] is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.  

so, basically, daemon runs everything in the background without users _knows_ about it, bet i bet you could apply this term into your relationship model (not the database, you fool. but real 3D relationship with other human. read my lips, HUMAN).

so, love is one of the daemon running in your background, either you feel/know it or not, love is a parent process that have a child process like miss each other, care, anger, jealousy. so when you feel like your  pupils dilated and your pulse elevated, that's the love if you can't tell what it is. 

you know it is there, you know you feel it, i know i feel it.
