The one that strikes me is, [Jen](https://lunchbag.ca/), the creator of Launch Money, she put some [extensive journey of making the Lunch Money app](https://lunchbag.ca/lunch-money/) in her blog, from designing, to launching it, it's a well written and also exciting journey, how she designed the app, start coding, and how she chose the tech stack of her app, and i love how this app supporting multicurrency from the beginning.
