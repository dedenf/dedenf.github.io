> We Handed A Loaded Weapon To 4-Year-Olds

The retweet button are powerful, powerful enough to destroy ones credibility, it can started with false news, with link of course, and people without context or without reading the link, will be trigger happy and it will clicked retweet button without thinking.

> The retweet and share, in other words, incentivize extreme, polarizing, and outrage-inducing content.

Very true, the last Indonesia presidential election are proof, the one who got the loudest voice are the true one, no matter how false the news is, no matter how much misinformation or just simply hoaxes, it doesn't matter, as long that tweet (or other re-share mechanism) supporting our view, judgement or their bias.

Combined that with [logical fallacy](/2019/07/logical-fallacy-kesesatan-berpikir), perfect weapon.
