[Noah](http://37signals.com/svn/writers/noah) at 37signal made a list about the chart that he need to display data.

> 1. When you want to show how something has changed over time, use a line chart.
> 2. When you want to show how something is distributed, use a histogram.
> 3. When you want to display summary information, use a table.

seeing this chart type for people other than devops people or developer i think it's enough to display data.
