Life is like a frequency, it has ups and down, sometime its down, sometimes deep, even too deep, and come back up, slow, fast, it keeps the balance, life will not just straight line all the way, it will have many things, the good, the bad, the great, the worst, it's all there.

Things will balance itself eventually, the thing that we thought is a big deal today, could be just a flick of an eye in the future, the lose, the achievement might put a dent in your life.

The thing the we cannot control, we can only sit and watch, see what's life gonna give us, and embrace it.

We can't change from where we are, but surely we can change where we are going.
