[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) huge fans!, while i was looking for a setting to disable spellchecker in Notion, since i'm writing an article using Indonesian, obviously spellchecker will throw a trantrum.

And looking at my device setting, oh my, i have a lot of device currently logging in to my account, there are even devices which i forgot to use, months and months ago.

[Even though alread established some workflow for writing](https://notes.dedenf.com/2019/03/blogging-workflow), but not for devices obviously.
