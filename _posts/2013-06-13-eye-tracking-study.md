A [study](http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf) by Bonita Sharif and Jonathan I. Maletic from Department of Computer Science
Kent State University about how the eye response to camelCase and under_score indentifier, or might be function or variable naming style.
>Visual effort is determined using six measures based on eye gaze data namely: fixation counts and durations. Although, no
difference was found between identifier styles with respect to accuracy, results indicate a significant improvement in time and lower visual effort with the underscore style.

personally, i like underscore rather than camelCase, it's more readable and concise, and easily to read between word.
