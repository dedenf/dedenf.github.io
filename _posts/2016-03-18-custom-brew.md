recently i've been lazy, too lazy, no coffee rituals, no fancy brewing tools, also no fancy coffee beans.
i've using Nestcafe instant coffee as my caffeine boost, but not just that, here's my recipe:

* Nescafe
* Milk
* Sugar (optional)

### how to make it

first heat the milk (half of the glass/cup/mug), i'm using microwave to heat the milk, after that, add Nescafe instant coffee (add sugar if you want to), mix it, after that pour hot water.

enjoy!
