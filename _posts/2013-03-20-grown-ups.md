read a post from [dalton caldwell](http://daltoncaldwell.com/) about [Touring yourself](http://daltoncaldwell.com/touring-by-yourself)

i love this quote

> Going “indie” is clearly not for everyone, but I have the utmost respect for the people that are able and willing to do it.

if you read the whole post, you'll get what his meant. and i think personally, there's a connection of how you become a grown ups, especially when you were married, you support your family by what you were doing right now.

that kinda responsibility is not bounded by age, any age who matches criteria like supporting family and the love ones is considered a grown-ups, responsible for himself and other.
