MacOS Tahoe, Apple new mac operating system, promising updates, like function and new UI, which is very bad, just like Windows Vista-*esque*, and now, new rant about how Apple designing its context menu, it is, "copying" windows ugly UI and HID.

> Icons are supposed to be easily recognizable from a distance. Every icon designer knows: small details are no-go. You can have them sometimes, maybe, for aesthetic purposes, but you can’t rely on them.

I have not yet upgrade or trying this new operating system, and it seems, will not use it in the near future.
