Today, after hour, finally got a chance to attend one of the hottest Meetup, JakartaJS, even though i came late to the Meetup, but it was fun. Met few friends there, catching up old story with my friend, updating what was what.
The presentation also quite fun, i just got there and people from **Yes Boss** is already giving their deck, i missed the first one.
