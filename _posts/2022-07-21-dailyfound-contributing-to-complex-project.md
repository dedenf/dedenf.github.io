Following [Mitchell](https://mitchellh.com/) for quite some time, and also a user of his/their product, Hashicorp, ranging from Vault, Vagrant, Terraform amongst other, his blog plot kinda resonate me.

To contribute a complex project, and sometime huge, huge and complex are deadly combo if we are not careful.

In this new teritoty, i was tasked with lots of tools and projects, even though i'm not the one who exclusively build it, but has occasional contribution to the projects, and to be honest it could be frustating, from a huge code base with lots of library, in-house build, custom or freely available.

So many things need to be consider, from stability, optimation, not to mention, security.

The approaches laid in this article are spot on.
