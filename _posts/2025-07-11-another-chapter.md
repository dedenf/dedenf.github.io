Moving on with life, one workplace to another. Since quitting from previous company, take more time with little one, since he had autism diagnosed couple years ago, with him, we (me and wife) visit quite a lot of therapy center.

And this time, Alhamdulillah, I'm back to the workforce again, with a lot of hope and dreams obviously, and pray that everything that we fought for does not wasted.
