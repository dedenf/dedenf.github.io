Small post dedicated about Serj, I’ve watched Game of thrones religiously, even though disappointed with the finale, and alread listen to Rain of castemere by Matt Berninger, recently just heard a version from Serj Tankian, the vocalist of System of a Down, oh god that is great version, i love this version a lot, you [should listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlkgbwmN9mQ)!.

My first exposure to Serj's voice, of course when they release self titled album, System of a down in 1998, and their following album, toxicity, there’s a lot of anger, tell the story of injustice in their lyric, and i love his voice, very distinct with other band in the same era, like limp bizkit (_meh?_), or other band (i also love Rage Against the Machine).
