it's been more than one month since i'm joining new office, my responsisbily now is as API developer, currently working at game publisher company, so much different from where i've been regarding the business process etc.

it's always hard to leave my previous job, at least for me, more than three years working with wonderful team, so many jokes that we invented there, so many memories.
we also have a soon to be launch product, [kineria.com](http://kineria.com/) a movie streaming service.

this time i'm building an API interface system and also build a social network for indonesian gamers, pretty much like Gree+Line, just starting my adventure here, we'll see how it goes.

so, did you game today?

PS: previous photo is my new office.
