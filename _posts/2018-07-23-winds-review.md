As i mentioned before, i love [RSS](http://notes.dedenf.com/2017/11/1on-rss), i consumed quite a lot of rss for news feed, source code feed push, and also i love Podcast, listened to [podcast](http://notes.dedenf.com/2018/01/podcast) for quite sometime, subscribed to a handful of podcast 'station'.

I used to listen podcast using either spotify, or soundcloud, itunes, depending on how the publisher published the podcast, but probably that will be change, right now i use [Winds app](https://getstream.io/winds/) by [getstream.io](https://getstream.io/).

The app displayed like it's a website, consist of podcast and rss news feed, i use Winds as my main podcast client, so simple and intuitive, support podfaster, bookmarking, also can resume it after we left of if we closed it.

For RSS news feed i still use Cappuccino as my main app, And for Winds I'm gonna use it for a while for my podcasting, and see how it goes.
