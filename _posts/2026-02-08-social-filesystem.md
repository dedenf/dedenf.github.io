It's an interesting takes of how the author construct and stuctured the everyday social interaction via app that was created by someone else platform and the users are the creator of the content.

Even though there's question of how the data was produced by the users, is the data belongs to the user or platform owner?

I admired the author explain with details, how the data stuctured, how it it construct the ATProtocol.
