1. [The Netflix API Optimization Story](http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/02/netflix-api-optimization)
this should be an epic read
2. [CPU Cache Flushing Fallacy](http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2013/02/cpu-cache-flushing-fallacy.html)
3. [Realtime Node.js App: Building a Server](http://weblog.bocoup.com/node-stress-test-server/)
Friend of mine is building an API for the app that one of the largest telco company in indonesia build, it used Node.js as its communication between internal telco's API and application layer and talk to the clients mobile app. so maybe i'll take a look for it.
