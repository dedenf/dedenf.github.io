Currently i'm trying to use Safari more than before, this idea coming because using Chrome is pain in the ass in terms of resources, and by simple thought, probably if i use Safari as a default browser it could dramatically change how my browsing experience and also its resources.

I still use El Capitan macOS, i hate Sierra, the iCloud integration seems annoying (i do have other backup strategy tho), i've installed Sierra on my other macs, and regretting it.

And using Safari (on El Capitan) did not improve my browsing experience, and sometimes the page did not loaded perfectly, probably the site, but *again* on Chrome it is smooth.

see the top menu position?   

probably if high Sierra released, i'll give it a try its Safari, according to WWDC, it has tons of improvements.
