Still about A.I, and the rise of AI, and it was not about the will rule the world with menace and kill every human like Terminator or The Matrix, it's our job, human deem to inefficient, obviously this is about money/revenue/profit of the company that adopt AI without considering human in its part, combined with company search for more profits, could be deadly for human.

Article from The Verge, [https://www.theverge.com/news/688679/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-ai-efficiency](https://www.theverge.com/news/688679/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-ai-efficiency)
> “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” Jassy says. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.”

And article from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-18/microsoft-planning-thousands-more-job-cuts-aimed-at-salespeople), where Microsoft reduce human workforce.

> The terminations would follow a previous round of layoffs in May that hit 6,000 people and fell hardest on product and engineering positions, largely sparing customer-facing roles like sales and marketing.

I think there will be more to come, not sure when this trend will be stop.
