Having read this [article](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/rip-browsers/), kinda scary to see the "progress" of the browser, where it will heading, and what technologies was baked into the browser.

Yes indeed, just like Jim, I love browsers. 

Using, reviewing many browser on my blog, probably because I used to develop websites, that needed a lot of testing, how the app work, is the UI works, how it interact with browsers, compatibilities etc.

Currently I am using few browsers, Brave, Orion, Zen, and Safari. previous browser I was using was Firefox, Arc, Chrome. The last three browser i was given up mostly because of the security, lack of innovations.

It is sad to see browser has more and more become a honeypot for data collections, or a trap for their users, it's like we are giving these companies a way to know us more and more deeper, and obviously they will sold the data to the higest bidder, for ads, for anything. The browser that I am using also the same, in some way, they will monetize their users, and with AI, and obviously its term & condition, will override the privacy feature, and browser company will have a way to collect more data.
