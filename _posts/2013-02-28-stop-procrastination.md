did you always stuck in the morning reading news, hundred of rss feed, Flipboarding(?), and last but not least, Twitter or Facebook. they can suck all of your productive time.

but there's a way to satisfy your need to tweets or update you status. you can use the tool that [hipster(?)] developer already knows, GIT.

see, i have a record **7.777** tweets right now, and i hate to break this number. and guess what, yes, i've been ranting/tweeting/etc via my commit message. This way i can get both satisfaction, by writing not-all-nonsense so-called tweet and i can get productive by making change on my code, if i want to 'tweet', i have to change/write codes!

P.S: i can also wrote a 'blog' [like this one](https://github.com/dedenf/vagrant/commit/7467f6c1708795016818718e2dd66fda82645a93), besides for my technical stuff i've been blogging on [coderwall.com](https://coderwall.com/dedenf)
