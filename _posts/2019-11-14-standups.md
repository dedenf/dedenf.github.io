> In any case prior to a launch, standups are mostly a waste of time. Thatâ€™s because the bulk of the product development process centers around (1) building (2) making decisions. 

This lines, is a hard truth.

I've fell to this also, we are gathering at the end of the day, and thinking that we are updating each other, but since the team grew, the "update" session became long, and it took people's time, and it's not okay.

The communication could be done by other type of communication, asynchronously. this way, people could finish their job.
