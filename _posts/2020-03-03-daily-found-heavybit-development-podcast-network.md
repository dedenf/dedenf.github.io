Welp, i found interesting podcast today, which is about [Observability and Test Engineers](https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/ep-16-observability-and-test-engineers-with-abby-bangser-of-moo/) from [O11ycast](https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/) at [Heavybit Podcast](https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/).

I did a presentation about [Observability](https://www.slideshare.net/AgileImpact/deden-fathurahman-observability-within-your-devops-environment-119173990) a while back at Agile Impact Conference, and this episode brings a lot more, and much more thorough, the host are the people i followed much on the interwebs, so it's a great fits!

Listen the [#16 Episode](https://d3aeja1uqhkije.cloudfront.net/podcasts/o11ycast/20200128-o11ycast-016.mp3).
