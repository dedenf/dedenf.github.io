Written by Cal Newport, one of my favorite writer, author, he tell the story about Getting things done movement in the past, even interviewing Merlin Mann and other authors, i have been using this techniques in the past, yes, it is sometimes did not worked as intended, overwhelmed, probably there are mistakes in my implementation, but still, this is a journey.

GTD made a framework, or model, it was not intended to have a right or wrong action, it's just how the way you managed your time, and making the best out of it.
