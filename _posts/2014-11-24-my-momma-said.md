my momma said, i'll be alright.
my momma said, everything you'll do that's because you want it.
my momma said, nothing ever last forever.
my momma said, you need to be more open.
my momma said, is that you?
my momma said, this is not who you are.
my momma said, this is not the reflection of your father.
my momma said, i want you to be happy.
