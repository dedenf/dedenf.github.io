Watching this, a blast from the past, remind me of the journey, experiencing the evolution of the desktop computing and its interface, both windows and mac.

Yes there's a lot of other OSes that i've been play with like OS/2, Novell netware, GNU/Linux (Suse, Slackware, Mandrake in particular), BSDs, Solaris.
