As geek as i can be, one of the things i love is reading release notes, especially from my favorite applications or useful packages.

Today just saw an update notification from Arc Browser, one of the browser i have been using intensively lately, beside [Brave Browser](/2019/09/menjaga-privasi-dan-keamanan-dalam-berinternet), and i was so excited to see what's new in this update.

They posted the release as attractive as it can be, shared internal discussion, video, some kind of behind the scene.

Some company release the release note or changelog as a blog post, some as a video, some as a tweet, some as a blog post with video, and sometimes, it can be as geek as it can be and confusing at the same time, big project like [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.30.md), but i still read it anyway.
