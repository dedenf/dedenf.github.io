- [Paris Syndrome: culture shock sickness sends Japanese tourists packing](http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2015/12/30/paris-syndrome-culture-shock-sickness-sends-japanese-tourists-packing)

Truth is, i'm a bit skeptical and confused sometimes about Node life cycle, and between major release don't know how many APIs that gonna be broken.
