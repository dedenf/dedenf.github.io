Recently geeking out with [Multipass](https://multipass.run/), i've blogged it on my TIL blog, it's a provisioning tools that could spin instance many operating system, a useful program, and reminded me with Vagrant, the tool that i have been use to provision an instance, it can be Linux, windows, macOS, as long as the driver is present.

Using [Multipass](https://multipass.run/) is easy, no complex command, and it's quite easy to integrate it with other virtualization driver.
