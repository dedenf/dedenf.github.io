This video speaks my worries, the thing that we probably think it is a harmless thing, like scrolling our phone, watching youtube, netflix or any other media consumption service, their main focus is our focus, our attention (some call it attention economy), even our time as human.

<iframe width="620" height="365" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZ8uNyX-QUc?si=-GwvariWdSbqG6r7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

We might not notice it, or notice it but tend or choose to ignore it, how many time we talk with our friends, families? talk as in an offline activity exchange words between two people or more, facing each other, not via whatsapp, email or other tools.

In the video there's people who bring actual grass to an event, to give them sense how to feel touching grass, real grass, mind boggling.

It's a reminder that there's a lot of thing in the outside world, not just your TikTok feeds, Instagram reels etc.
