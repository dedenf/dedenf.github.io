- [What ORMs have taught me: just learn SQL](http://woz.posthaven.com/what-orms-have-taught-me-just-learn-sql) -- Yes, ORM could save you a lot of time, but it also kills you, you became more and more forgetting how the SQL works, or sometimes you forgot how to do the simple `JOIN` queries. ORM just please use it wisely.
