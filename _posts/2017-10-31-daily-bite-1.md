- [Software architecture is failing](https://www.alexhudson.com/2017/10/14/software-architecture-failing/?utm_source=dedenf)   
Interesting read, and in fact reflects to at least my professional life, the over-designed and over-architecture system that sometimes hurting the delivery, not to mention the business. the point to make in my opinion is as developer we should be wise and also thoughful using all the hyped or cool kids technologies

- [How awesome engineers ask for help](https://hackernoon.com/how-awesome-engineers-ask-for-help-93bcb2c7dbb7?utm_source=dedenf)   
Communication is the key in development word, communication can be anywhere and using any tools that we have, slack, telegram, whatsapp, or even in the codes, how we connect with other developer and so, but sometimes ego will kill it all, the attitude like i'm the best, i don't need help from the other. remember there are human behind the code that we wrote, human who make it all possible, your colleague, your open source tools that you use.

- [Dark chocolate is now a health food](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/10/18/15995478/chocolate-health-benefits-heart-disease)   
My wife would love this, the chocolate that we know right now for example from cadburry, kitkat or lindt, etc. are not pure chocolate, the main ingredient are mostly sugar and fat. but dark chocolate is different, i love dark chocolate, much more tasteful and now it is officially healthy.
