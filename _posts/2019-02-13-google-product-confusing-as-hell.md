I love podcast, listen to it almost everyday, from tech new, software development, to financial. i used to listening podcast using castbox, but it had its limit, it had subscription if you want to add podcast more than 100(?), i'm switching to Google podcast now, it has decent feature, so basic, no categorizing, no playlist, been try this app for quite sometimes now.

And i opened Google Music, especially the web app. the app has different UI with Google Podcast, but it also offering the same menu as Google Podcast, a podcast. why would they offer the same thing to different app? and Google are famous to killing their app or feature when many people are using it.

Maybe i'm just too attached with Google Podcast.
