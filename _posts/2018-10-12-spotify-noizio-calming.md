Since i love genre like triphop, lounge, chill etc, and i also love rain, love the sound, and it smells, a _Pluviophile_ they said.

To have maximum concentration are hard, using an open office for some people probably a good thing, [but not for other people](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-open-plan-office-is-a-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-idea-42bd9cd294e3), and the solution are, people start wearing headphones/earphone to have a maximum focus.

To have that focus, i tend to use these tool, yes, i use earphone, and listened to [Jinsang](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5FsfZj0Mp6YwEWytuJUcWt) or [Barasuara](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5RbI1PF4n02wWKmgjk7hAE), and install this app called [Noizio](https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/noizio-focus-relax-sleep/id928871589?mt=12), their [website](http://noiz.io/).   
Listening to music and sound of rain and people chatter in the background (it's a Noizio sound btw), and sometimes thunder (Noizio also), is quite comforting and i have a bit of focus and can do deep work.
