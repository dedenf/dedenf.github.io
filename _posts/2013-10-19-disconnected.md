[A life less posted](http://www.elezea.com/2012/11/a-life-less-posted/), a story about how awesome we could spend our time with our significant other, without a 'burden' to share, a 'burden' about how we socialize with others. Some might say that if we're not on facebook or other social media site, we didn't exist.

we share almost everything, what we eat, what we wear, who we go out, and we share our own children, post them online with no consideration whatsoever. is that good or bad? i don't know.
