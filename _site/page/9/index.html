Many advice for an inspiring tech managers, the list and experience by Adil Ajmal are gold, how the engineer accept its roles, and how they become a team player. Mesuring projects, performances, so on. and i’m quite intrigued by this:
    <blockquote>
      <p>I believe that architecting a system is the responsibility of all engineers who have to build and maintain that system and not the exclusive responsibility of a single individual or a team of individuals who just tell others what to do without actually building the system themselves.</p>

      <p>But now most software is so much more than that. It listens to us. It goes everywhere we go. It tracks everything we do. It has our fingerprints. Our heart rate. Our money. Our location. Our face. It’s the primary way we communicate our thoughts and feelings to our friends and family. <br />
It’s deeply personal and ingrained into every aspect of our lives. It commands our gaze more and more every day.</p>
