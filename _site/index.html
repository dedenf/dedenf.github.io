Many advice for an inspiring tech managers, the list and experience by Adil Ajmal are gold, how the engineer accept its roles, and how they become a team player. Mesuring projects, performances, so on. and i’m quite intrigued by this:
    <blockquote>
      <p>I believe that architecting a system is the responsibility of all engineers who have to build and maintain that system and not the exclusive responsibility of a single individual or a team of individuals who just tell others what to do without actually building the system themselves.</p>

It’s deeply personal and ingrained into every aspect of our lives. It commands our gaze more and more every day.</p>
