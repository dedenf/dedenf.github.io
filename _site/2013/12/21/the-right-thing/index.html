  <p>spoilers: there is no the right thing. <br />
at least for something you didn’t know or something you thing you didn’t know, you have to walk through it to get the answer, there’s no The Oracle who can guide you make your choice. how can you tell which decision is right or wrong? well you don’t, at least until you live with that decision.</p>

<p>if you watch The Matrix trilogy movie, there’s a lot scene and dialog involving choices, here’s one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Neo: But if you already know, how can I make a choice? The Oracle: Because you didn’t come here to make the choice, you’ve already made it. You’re here to try to understand why you made it. I thought you’d have figured that out by now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Oracle is a powerful program, she cannot say what Neo should do with his own choices.</p>

<p>and please, there is no such thing as coincidence. everything happen as it is. there’s no adjustment bureau, or yourself from the future to change what choices you’ve made.</p>
